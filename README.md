## Obtaining Graph Embedding
Within this repo, I've been trying several methods to extract graph-level embedding, in the form of a fixed-size vector, from a directed graph.

```bash
├── infograph -  use unsupervised method but failed
│   ├── dataset - customed dataset
├── line
├── graph2vec - use networkX + karateclub.graph2vec API
```
